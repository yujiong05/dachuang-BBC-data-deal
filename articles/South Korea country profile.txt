South Korea has developed into one of Asia's most affluent countries since partition in 1948. The Communist North has slipped into totalitarianism and poverty.

The republic was proclaimed in 1948 and received UN-backed support from the US after it was invaded by the North two years later.

The Korean War ended in 1953 without a peace agreement, leaving South Korea technically at war for more than 70 years.

The following four decades were marked by authoritarian rule, during which government-sponsored schemes encouraged the growth of family-owned industrial conglomerates, including the Hyundai and Samsung groups.

They helped transform South Korea into one of the world's major economies and a leading exporter of cars and electronic goods.

The US has tens of thousands of soldiers in the country.

In December 2024, South Korea experienced political turmoil after a short-lived attempted coup by President Yoon Suk Yeol led to his impeachment by lawmakers.

President Yoon was impeached by parliament in December 2024 following his failed attempt to impose martial law on 3 December.

However, shortly afterwards, parliament voted to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo, as well.

Han had been tasked with leading the country out of its political turmoil, but opposition MPs argued that he was refusing demands to complete Yoon's impeachment process.

This was the first time an acting president had been impeached since South Korea became a democracy.

Finance minister Choi Sang-mok is set to replace Han as acting president.

South Korea is a trailblazer for high-speed and wireless internet and nearly every household is connected. Instant messaging and gaming enjoy huge popularity.
