The BBC's Stephen McDonell gets a rare glimpse inside China's launch base as two astronauts blast off to spend 30 days in orbit in the Tiangong 2 space lab.

It will be the longest stay in space ever by Chinese astronauts, and is seen as a pointer to possible crewed missions to the Moon or Mars in future.
